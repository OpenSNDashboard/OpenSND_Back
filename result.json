        "selftext": "I know you're here to get quick help with your command problems or to show off your cool work. Please read these few lines to get to know how to use this subreddit optimally:\n\n# Asking for help\n\n1. **FAQ?** Before you post, please check out the [common questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/wiki/questions) (including answers) that we have in our subreddits wiki. These consist of the most common problems, and maybe your problem is already covered there in detail?\n2. **Titles:** Please put a summary/short version of your problem into the title of your post, don't just put \"I need help\" or \"help me plz\". Instead put for example \"how do I summon a zombie\" or \"unable to summon entity error\" and then provide more context on the post itself. This subreddit often shows up on google when people search for command related questions and we should really help them find the questions you might already have asked. Also, we likely know that you need help anyways, no need to put it in the title.\n3. **Flairs:** We have a wide array of flairs that you should attach to your post to make sure people know what the purpose of your thread is. It is *especially important* if you're asking for help, to flair your post with the appropriate minecraft version (for those who don't know: OG Minecraft is `Java` Version, everything else that has commands (Xbox, PE, PS4, Switch, Win10, etc) is `Bedrock`).\n4. **Version:** Whether you're helping or asking for help, *please pay attention to the stated version/state the version you're in!* You can do that through the previously mentioned Flairs, but also in addition can put it into the description of your post.\n5. **Search/Scroll down:** I know that reddit search is not the best one out there, but maybe someone else had a similar problem to yours in recent history. Try going to the new tab and scrolling down a bit or using the reddit search function to see if there might already be an answer to a question you have. *We're not going to close your thread for asking the same question someone else asked a year ago, we're not StackOverflow. But please at least take 30 seconds to look for it first.*\n6. **Upvote**: If you find an answer to a post helpful, please upvote it. This is less as a \"reward\" for the answering person but more as a way to automatically move the best answer to the top, for others that might have the same problem. Don't downvote an answer just because their attempts didn't work for you unless it's completely wrong or off topic / doesn't add anything to the conversation.\n\n# Creations\n\nPosting about your own creations is very much encouraged, but please remember the [10:1 guidelines of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n\n# Discord\n\nWe have a big Discord Server for our community with lots of channels, ranging from dedicated help chats over general command related chats to non-command related chats. So if you want to join an active community of command and mapmaking enthusiasts and/or want to get quick help where communication is less slow *(Sometimes the devs stop by as well ;))*, click on the link and join our community discord:  \n[https://discord.gg/9wNcfsH](https://discord.gg/9wNcfsH)  \nMake sure you read the #welcome channel for the rule of the discord.",
